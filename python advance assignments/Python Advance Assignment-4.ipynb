    "### Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "Ans: __iter__ and __next__ are the operator overloading methods in python that support iteration and are collectively called iterator protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "__iter__ returns the iterator object and is called at the start of loop in our respective class.\n",
    "\n",
    "__next__ is called at each loop increment, it returns the incremented value. Also Stopiteration is raised when there is no value to return."

    "Ans: __str__ and __repr__ are two operator overloading methods that manage printing.\n",

    "In Short, the difference between both these operators is the goal of __ repr__ is to be unambiguous and __ str__ is to be readable.\n",

    "Whenever we are printing any object reference internally __ str__ method will be called by default.\n",
    "\n",

    "__ repr__ is used to print official string representation of an object, so it includes all information and development."
